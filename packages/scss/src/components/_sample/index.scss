// This file contains all the connections required to make the component functional.
// The componentâ€™s mixins are requested, then assigned to classes.
// To add the component to the list of all existing components, call it from `components/index` with `@forward 'sample';`.
// Modifiers and states are optional and must be prefixed by `.mod-` and `.is-`.
// A responsive mixin and varible define the default behaviour but can be overridden. All this settings must be preserved.
