<h2>Select and its picker</h2>
<p>
	The <code>lu-select</code> component is just a <code>InputWithPicker</code>. Which means it is an input (it implements the control value accessor), and it has a picker (a popover that help picking a value).
</p>
<p>
	The most important notion here is that the select components delegate the logic of displaying a list of options to its picker, while handling the 2-way data binding (as a control value accessor)
</p>
<p>
	So even if in these examples we only use a <code>lu-option-picker</code>, you can use whatever picker you want as long as it implements the interface <code>IPickerPanel</code>. you can have a select with a date-picker, a color-picker, etc...
</p>
<p>
	Another important notion is that the <code>lu-select</code> has no idea how to properly display the current value, so you must pass him a <code>InputDisplayer</code>
</p>
<p>
	In the same vein, you can pass the select any <code>select-clearer</code> and it will display it in the right place and clear itself when the clearer calls <code>onClear</code>
