<h1>Option picker</h1>
<p>
	As seen in the <a href="/select/foundations">select foundations</a>, the select can work with any <i>picker</i> but it is used primarilly with the <code>lu-option-picker</code>
</p>
<p>
	At its core, the <code>lu-option-picker</code> allows you to pick from a list of options. But it supports several ways to get to this list of option
</p>
<p>
	You can just provide a list of option like so :
</p>
<demo-example-box [snippets]="snippets" demo="basic">
	<basic></basic>
</demo-example-box>
<p>
	or use a system of operators, components that allow you to define and manipulate a list of option before displaying it. you add them as content child of the picker and it will chain them
</p>
<demo-example-box [snippets]="snippets" demo="operator">
	<operator></operator>
</demo-example-box>
<p>
	Also of note, the picker listens to any kind of <code>ALuOptionItem</code>, so you can use the component <code>lu-option</code>, like in all above examples, or define your own type of option with its templating
</p>
<demo-example-box [snippets]="snippets" demo="custom">
	<custom></custom>
</demo-example-box>
